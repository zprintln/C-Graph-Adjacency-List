# C-Graph-Adjacency-List
This repository contains a C implementation of essential graph algorithms using an adjacency list representation. The project offers a graph data structure with functions for creating and managing graphs, adding nodes and edges, finding nodes, and performing various graph-related operations like checking reachability and detecting cycles.
